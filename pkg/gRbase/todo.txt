* There seems to be a bug in the C implmentation of mcs. Need to
  reimplement this for sparse and standard adjacency matrices.

* is.DAG, is.UG, is.TUG: not yet implemented for igraph's

* mcsmarked and jTree: not yet implemented for Matrix.

* all .Matrix methods should be .dgCMatrix methods.
