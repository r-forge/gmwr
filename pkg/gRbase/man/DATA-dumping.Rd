\details{
Gastric dumping syndrome is a condition where ingested foods bypass the stomach too rapidly and enter 
the small intestine largely undigested. It is an undesirable side-effect of gastric surgery. The table summarizes the
results of a study comparing four different surgical operations on patients with duodenal ulcer,
carried out in four centres, as described in Grizzle et al (1969). The four
operations were: vagotomy and drainage, vagotomy and antrectomy (removal
of 25\% of gastric tissue), vagotomy and hemigastrectomy (removal of 50\% of
gastric tissue), and gastric restriction (removal of 75\% of gastric tissue).
