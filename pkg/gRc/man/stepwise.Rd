\title{Stepwise model selection in RCOX models}
\description{
  These allow for stepwise model selection in RCOX models by. Model
  expansion (i.e. forward selection) is obtained by adding edge colour
  classes and by splitting edge/vertex colour classes.
  Model reduction (i.e. backward selection) is obtained by dropping edge
  colour classes and by joining edge/vertex colour classes.
}
\usage{
stepadd1  (object, criterion = "aic", steps = 1000, k = 2, alpha = 0.05,
headlong=FALSE, random=TRUE, details=1, trace=0,...)
stepdrop1 (object, criterion = "aic", steps = 1000, k = 2, alpha = 0.05,
stat = "wald", headlong=FALSE, random=TRUE, details=1, trace=0,...) 
stepjoin1 (object, scope, type = "ecc", criterion = "aic", steps = 1000, k = 2, alpha = 0.05, stat = "wald",   details = 1, trace=0) 
stepsplit1(object, type = "ecc", criterion = "aic", steps = 1000, k = 2, alpha = 0.05, stat = "wald",   details = 1, trace=0)

\arguments{
  \item{object}{An RCOX model, an object of class RCOX}
  \item{scope}{A set (list) of items (edge colour classes or vertex
    colour classes) to be considered. If missing, then
    all items are considered.}
  \item{criterion}{Either "aic" (the default), "bic" or "test" (for
    significance test)}
  \item{type}{Either "ecc" for edge colour classes or "vcc" for vertex
    colour classes.}
  \item{k}{The multiple of the number of degrees of freedom used for the
    penalty when criterion is "aic". Ignored when criterion is "bic" or
    "test". Only k = 2 gives the genuine AIC.}
  \item{steps}{The maximum number of steps to be considered. The default
    is 1000 (essentially as many as required). It is typically used to
    stop the process early} 
  \item{stat}{Either "wald" for a Wald statistic or "dev" for a
    deviance statistic.}
  \item{alpha}{Critical value if 'criterion' is "test". If criterion is
    "aic" or "bic", the critical value is 0.}
  \item{headlong}{If TRUE then at each step 
    the first encountered edge that may be removed/added according to the current criterion is done so.
  }
  \item{random}{If TRUE, then the edges are examined in random order}
  \item{details}{Control the amount of output created.}
  \item{trace}{For debugging purposes}
  \item{...}{Additional arguments, currently not used.}

  Note that the keyword 'stat' is not available for stepadd1  and
  stepsplit1 because these functions expand
  the current model and hence the Wald statistic is not available.
