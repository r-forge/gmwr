	* The package was removed from CRAN; new version created to get
	package back on CRAN again

	* Version 0.4-1 uploaded	

2003-20-03 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@math.aau.dk>

	* citation file, namespace file added; affiliation changed
	
	* Version 0.4-0 uploaded
	
2008-09-09 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@agrsci.d>

	* Scorematching (for RCON models) implemented in C

	* Version 0.3.0 uploaded


2008-07-13 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@agrsci.d>

	* Taken into account that Rgraphviz may not be installed...

	* 'ipms' estimation method added

	* Various optimizations

	* Rgraphviz is no longer required, but if it is installed then
	plot() will produce graphs.

	* Version 0.2.2 uploaded

2008-05-07 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@agrsci.d>

	* ipm algorithm for RCON optimized

	* Version 0.2.1 uploaded 

	
2008-04-23 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@math.aau.dk>

	* ipm algorithm for RCON models implemented in C

	* trXXXX functions implemented in C

	* Various other optimizations
	
	* Version 0.2.0 uploaded 

	
2008-03-11 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@math.aau.dk>

	* fit method matches generic fit function from gRbase

	* Version 0.1.4 uploaded 

	
2008-03-10 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@math.aau.dk>

	* Minor bugs fixed

	* Version 0.1.3 uploaded


2008-01-08 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@math.aau.dk>

	* Bug fixed so that also unfitted models can be plotted

	* extractIndexMatrix has been implemented in C (there remains an
	issue of that the matrices are converted to doubles to get the
	code to work. That should not be necessary?)

	* Some trace functions are implemented in C

	* Finding standard representation has been speeded up

	* stepjoin1 now accepts a scope argument (stepsplit1 does not - yet!)

	* Various minor bugs fixed.

	* Version 0.1.2 uploaded


2007-12-27 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@math.aau.dk>

	* Some output has been modified

	* Model objects changed from class RCOX to class rcox
	
	* gRc version 0.1.1 uploaded


2007-12-20 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@math.aau.dk>

	* gRc version 0.1.0 uploaded to CRAN
